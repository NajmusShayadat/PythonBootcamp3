# Function Practice Exercises
# Problems are arranged in increasing difficulty:
#
# Warm-up - these can be solved using basic comparisons and methods
# Level 1 - these may involve if/then conditional statements and simple methods
# Level 2 - these may require iterating over sequences, usually with some kind of loop
# Challenging - these will take some creativity to solve

# LEVEL 2 PROBLEMS:

# NUMBER 1
# FIND 33:
# Given a list of ints, return True if the array contains a 3 next to a 3 somewhere.

# has_33([1, 3, 3]) → True
# has_33([1, 3, 1, 3]) → False
# has_33([3, 1, 3]) → False
