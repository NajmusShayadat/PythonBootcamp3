# Function Practice Exercises
# Problems are arranged in increasing difficulty:
#
# Warm-up - these can be solved using basic comparisons and methods
# Level 1 - these may involve if/then conditional statements and simple methods
# Level 2 - these may require iterating over sequences, usually with some kind of loop
# Challenging - these will take some creativity to solve

# CHALLENGING PROBLEMS:
# NUMBER 1
# SPY GAME: Write a function that takes in a list of integers and returns True if it contains 007 in order

# spy_game([1,2,4,0,0,7,5]) --> True
# spy_game([1,0,2,4,0,5,7]) --> True
# spy_game([1,7,2,0,4,5,0]) --> False
